# ABAQUS_periodic_boundary_condition_generator
A nifty little GUI for node matching on master-slave surfaces, pairing them and generating lines for use in input file for periodic boundary conditions.

## Prerequisites

* python >= 3.7
* PySimpleGui <https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## Features
* includes adding strain as displacement of dummy node.

## Usage
* Should be used top to down step-by-step.
